# Speed Math (review)

## What I did right:
- Deploying my backend on render.com and my frotend with gh-pages was easy and painless
- First time integrating tensorflow and tensorflow.js in a React app
- Created my own algorithm to read multiple handwritten digits
- Added a working loader
- Made a simple UI
- Pushed to finish the app despite getting bored and annoyed with bugs

## What I did wrong:
- Put all my updates in one GitHub push
- Didn't think about the entire UI
- Was on-and-off with the project
- Digit reader is very innacurate
- No feedback for incorrect or correct answers

## Improvements for next project:
- Before coding, do the following:
  - Make a list of all the bare-minimum features
  - Create the entire UI plan (Figma now works on the browser)
  - Create a list of tasks for the entire app
- I need more experience in ML and tensorflow (just do more projects)
